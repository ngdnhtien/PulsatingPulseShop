# PulsatingPulseShop

Welcome to PPS quantum mechanic shop. For over 3 years, PulsatingPulseShop has never been a leader in the field of quantum maintenance and repair industry. However, we have young and ambitious people with a wide range of specialties . 

We have experience with all sorts of superconducting quantum machines, ranging from the classic 1990's Cooper-pair box to the 2007's everyone-knows-and-loves transmon qubits. Unlike most shops that restrict themselves within a two-dimensional Hilbert space, we made substantial efforts to climb higher to a territory called qudit. We're currently stopping at $d = 3$. 

In short, we calibrate microwave pulses to steer the dynamics of these objects, run foundational experiments on them, and learn a thing or two every day about how noisy they are.
