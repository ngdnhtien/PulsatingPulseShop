    "    - When sweeping over the range of 100 amplitudes, a 2D normal distribution should have two points with minimal variance. The two points correspond to the |1> and the |2> state.\n",
    "    - This way, a good duration corresponds to the case when the second variance reaches the minimum of mimimum.\n",
    "    - Also, this is a very good way of \"knowing\" exactly whether it is a |2> state. \n",
    "    - This is because, once you have a state that is an eigenstate of the \"Pauli Z12\", you have a 1 on 1 chance of measuring that state. "
